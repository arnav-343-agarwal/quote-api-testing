# ðŸ“œ Random Quote Generator

This is a small JavaScript project built as a part of my **DOM manipulation revision**.

It fetches random quotes from a public API and displays them dynamically on the screen using core concepts of the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fetches a random quote from [dummyjson.com/quotes](https://dummyjson.com/quotes)
- Displays quote, author, and fetch timing
- Uses Bootstrap for simple styling
- Clean and modular JavaScript structure

## ðŸ§  Why I Built This

While learning frameworks like **React** and **Next.js**, itâ€™s easy to forget how updates actually happen in the browser.

This project was a refresher on:

- Selecting and updating DOM elements using vanilla JS
- Understanding how **rendering works** behind the scenes
- Getting a feel for what React/NextJS **abstracts away** when they use their virtual DOM and re-rendering techniques

By doing this manually, I got a better appreciation for how frameworks optimize DOM updates internally.

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- HTML
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Bootstrap 5
- Fetch API
